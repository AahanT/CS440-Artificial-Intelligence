## Course Information:

This course provides an introductory survey of concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence. Intelligence is the ability to decide, learn, plan, understand, communicate, perceive, and act; AI is the creation of machines that do these things. This course gives a one- or two-week introduction to each of the seven aspects of intelligence, with pointers to key mathematical concepts, articles and books.

Topics covered:
- World modeling with symbolic and statistical representations:
- First-order logic, formal inference, the qualification problem
- Random Variables & Distributions, Conditional independence, Bayes &Markov nets, Parameter estimation
- Tradeoffs among expressiveness, efficiency, accuracy, & robustness
- Sequential decision making: Classical planning, Reinforcement learning, Markov decision processes
- Machine learning: Supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised
- Linear classifiers: Perceptrons, Naïve Bayes, Logistic regression
- Nonlinear classifiers: Neural networks, Support vector machines & kernel methods
- Computational learning theory: learnability, VC analysis
- Statistical learning theory: error bounds, regularization
- AI Applications: NLP, vision, search engines, data mining, collaborative filtering
- Social & philosophical implications
